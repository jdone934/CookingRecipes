|Item |Considerations| Comments/Suggestions|
|--------|---------|---|
|||Reviewer comments and suggestions go here. Each item should have *at least* one "kudos" and two suggestions for improvement|
|**Problem Statement**|1. Accurately describes project purpose<br> 2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.<br> 3. Fully explains the problem and the solution<br> 4. Is understandable by the average person|Kudos<br>1. The explanation for the motivation behind completing this particular project fells very comprehensive.<br><br>Suggestions<br>1. There could be a little more explanation how you intend to fix the problem.<br>2. Maybe be worth calling out that you are using EC2 for Amazon Web Services.|
|**Design Documentation**|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use. <br>2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use <br>3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use<br>4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens |Kudos<br>1. The screen designs are well laid out very logically and bring the users attention to the right spots.<br>2. Application Flow outlines the project very well.<br><br>Suggestions<br>1. A few of the items in your Application Flow could be fleshed out (i.e, under the 'Contact' section, what happens after the user submits the form? Do they recieve confirmation?)<br>2. I don't see any mention of admin abilities in your design documents. <br>3. Use of more icons may make your site more useable.|
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model <br> 2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.<br> 3. The model represents good database design <br>|Kudos<br>1. Design encompasses the project as it's laid out in the rest of your desgin documents.<br><br>Suggestions<br>1. It's difficult to tell from the diagram, but I belive there to be a many-to-many relationship between 'MENU_ITEMS' and 'USER_FAVORITES'. If this is the case, make sure to utilize an associative table.<br>2. If 'OUTCOMES' is just going to be an id and a name, this likely doesn't need to be it's own table and could just be a value in 'CARBOHYDRATES' |
|**Code**|1. Proper Maven project structure is used<br> 2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented <br> 3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes<br> 4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes)<br> Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values <br> 5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.<br> 6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverages.|Kudos<br>1. Code is very clean and easy to read. <br>2. Everything is well documented<br><br>Suggestions<br>1. You seem to test a lot of getters and setters. This may be personal preference, but it feels a bit gratuitous to me.<br>2. On line 52 of 'UserRoleTest', you have a line 'assertEquals(1,1)' that should likely be 'assertEquals(1,id)'|
