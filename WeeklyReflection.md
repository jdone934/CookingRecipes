# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles. 


### Week 1

Week Starting 1/19/2020 - 2.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Reviewed intro course materials. Watched videos to prep for week 1. 
 * Began thinking about a project goal
 * Completed Week 1 Assignments
 
I spent a large portion of this week trying to figure out what to do for my individual project. I'm bad at coming up with large ideas like this, so I expected trying to come up with an idea to run up to the last minute.

Intro materials for the course went over well

### Week 2

Week Starting 1/26/2020 - 4 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Searched for technologies I may want to base my project around.
* Discovered ability to control a website with Alexa. 
* Did some preliminary research on how feasible this is.
* Finalized project idea.
* Developed Project Plan.
* Watched videos and completed exercises/activities for Week 2.

I feel a little behind last week, so i put in some extra work to get caught up this week. I made sure to complete this weeks work and get a start on Week 3 materials to get caught up.

I spent a large amount of time this week trying to finalize my vision for the final project. After stumbling across this technology that allows you to control a website with Alexa, I wanted to come up with a project that would allow me to use this technology. I've recently began cooking more, so that was on my mind and I decided on a website to store cooking recipes that was easy to use while cooking.

After doing some preliminary research, I think it is feasible to pursue this Alexa route. I'm definitely planning on it being an add on feature, but I'm deeply hoping to include it in the final project.

### Week 3

Week Starting 2/2/2020 - 1 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Watched videos and read materials for Week 3

Unfortunately, work got in the way this week and I had to prioritize other things in my personal/work life above work for this class. Things should clear up next week and I will have to make up for it then.

### Week 4

Week Starting 2/9/2020 - 6 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Completed activities and assignments for Week 3
* Completed Project Plan and created directory and skeletons for design documents
* Completed design documents (including wireframes, application flow, user stories and Project Plan)
* Read materials for week 4

As I mentioned in week 3, I'm putting in some extra time this week to catch up. The bulk of my work this week was spent in putting the materials together for the project 1 checkpoint (Project plan and design documents).

### Week 5

Week Starting 2/16/2020 - 3 hours 

Tasks Completed:
* Completed Exercise for week 4
* Watched videos for week 5
